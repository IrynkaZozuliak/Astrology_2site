            <p class="pp_cont_element_test">I would like to express my gratitude to Kate Sun for an informative and comprehensive consultation. Earlier, I'd turned to astrologers and I can say that I always had questions, many things were not clear, consultations were always limited to a clear framework and time. But, Kate gave me as much time as needed to fully analyze my chart and found answers to all my questions.</p>

            <p class="pp_cont_element_test">This was the first time in my life when a professional astrologer calculated my natal chart. And this is a totally positive experience. Kate was able to help me prioritize and uncover what I thought was “beyond seven seals”. Thanks for the professional work and positive approach. Now I see what are my strengths and weaknesses and where is my life path leading me to.</p>

            <p class="pp_cont_element_test">I am very grateful for the consultation. It became clear who I am and what it is better to devote my life to. I had many questions that took shape over many years, but I couldn’t find the answers to them myself, I had a lot of guesses, and after the consultation, thanks to astrology, I got the feeling that it all came together for me, it became clear what ... where ... and why.</p>

            <p class="pp_cont_element_test">I'd always been interested in stars. I didn’t just love horoscopes, I wanted to learn how to understand the stars and their influence on people. Since September I have been studying at the Beginners course by astrologer Kate Sun. I have already learned how to draw up natal charts, I have done it for myself, for my husband, for all my friends, and I will continue to do astrology professionally.</p>
