          What is your life’s potential? ​How can you ​align yourself with ​the

          Far too often healing is geared towards elevating attributes that are
          deemed valuable by the status quo. I believe that what makes us
          different informs our humanity and that our humanity is our greatest
          asset. I believe that what we have survived can eventually help us to
          thrive. I believe that we all have within us the wisdom that we need at
          any and every moment. Sometimes we need a guide to get there, other
          times we do it all on our own. I offer what I know in hopes that it
          stimulates and awakens others’ ability to access their own wisdom.

              I have been a student of astrology since I was 18 years old and a
              counseling astrologer for almost 20 years. My horoscopes can be read
              in many popular magazines, such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, The New
              York Times and more. I make personal readings for businessmen,
              traders, investors, actors, doctors and ordinary people who believe
              that stars can tell us much about the life path.

              I aim to make astrology practical, approachable, and useful.
              Otherwise it’s all just cosmic hot air and planets far from reach. I
              hope to be in a dialogue with you about what you would like to know
              as it pertains to astrology, and how I can best serve you.
