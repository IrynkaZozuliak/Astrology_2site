          What is your life’s potential? ​How can you ​align yourself with ​the
          ​stars energies to feel more in tune and more connected to what’s going
          on inside and outside of you?

          Far too often healing is geared towards elevating attributes that are
          deemed valuable by the status quo. I believe that what makes us
          different informs our humanity and that our humanity is our greatest
          asset. I believe that what we have survived can eventually help us to
          thrive. I believe that we all have within us the wisdom that we need at
          any and every moment. Sometimes we need a guide to get there, other
          times we do it all on our own. I offer what I know in hopes that it
          stimulates and awakens others’ ability to access their own wisdom.

              I have been a student of astrology since I was 18 years old and a
              counseling astrologer for almost 20 years. My horoscopes can be read
              in many popular magazines, such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, The New
              York Times and more. I make personal readings for businessmen,
              traders, investors, actors, doctors and ordinary people who believe
              that stars can tell us much about the life path.

              I aim to make astrology practical, approachable, and useful.
              Otherwise it’s all just cosmic hot air and planets far from reach. I
              hope to be in a dialogue with you about what you would like to know
              as it pertains to astrology, and how I can best serve you.
